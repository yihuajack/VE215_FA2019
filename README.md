# VE215_Lab
 
Pre-lab assignment 3-5&6 PSpice files are referred to Cai Yiteng. Note that in Lab 5 you need to measure input signal amplitude in Vppk or (m)Vppk for each frequency in each part. Besides, the MATLAB code for Lab 5 is adapted from Liu Yihao's version, but make quite a bit modifications. The expected transfer function magnitude and the expected transfer function magnitude in dB on the datasheet are completed by the trio in lab so may have errors. More reliable values should be referred to the values generated by MATLAB in *.tex file. By the way, the photos in Lab 4 may have wrong correspondence to the sine wave and the square wave in Part I and Part II, so they are listed in the end of Section 4 together.

Since we do not need to submit all the files to Canvas but only the PDF files, so the manuals and data sheets are also included in each folders. However, all of them contain no information about authours and revisors and references.

As is shown in the titlepage of each report, the cooperators are Fang Han and Cai Yiteng.
